    storyGroupBio: 'In a small, niched orbit of the classical music world six friends found each other: we regularly nerded out about anything historical performance, performed side by side in some of the world’s best baroque bands, and giggled the night away any chance we had. After frequently crossing paths, we recognized a growing synergy sparked by a mutual desire to expand the performance potential of early music. With excitement and delight, we founded Relic, a small chamber orchestra with the goal of producing textured, theatrical performances for an all-engaging experience. We’re inspired to usher baroque music in a fresh, spirited direction. Our aim is to create thoughtful performances at the highest level; share the joy of our art; and educate the world about the rich, ornamental wonders of our first love, historical performance.',

    aboutStory: 'Once upon a time, six musicians encountered each other frequently at various concerts, rehearsals, and social gatherings across the United States. Through the sharing of ideas and aspirations, they recognized a mutual spark: an impulse to contribute to the accessibility and expansion of early music in small and large communities around the country. Backstage chats, onstage synergy and shared commutes led to the foundation of strong friendships and deep musical bonds. In a heartbeat, Relic was born.',
