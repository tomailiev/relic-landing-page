        "bio": " (violin) began his musical studies at the age of four when, inspired by his older sister’s example, he started taking piano lessons. But at the age of six sibling rivalry led him to another instrument - the violin. Growing up Toma was fascinated by Antonio Vivaldi’s music - specifically the violin and bassoon concerti - which he listened to on vinyl before it was cool. His passion for early music led Toma to Indiana University where he was introduced to the baroque violin by Stanley Ritchie, and later to the Juilliard School’s Historical Performance program. Toma enjoys a vibrant career as a soloist, chamber, and orchestral musician. He regularly performs with leading early music ensembles including Handel and Haydn Society, Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, American Bach Soloists, and Portland Baroque Orchestra. Toma is a core member of Sonnambula who served as the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2018-19 Ensemble in Residence, and he recently appeared with Joyce DiDonato and Il Pomo d’Oro for performances across the United States and Canada. Toma holds several honors and awards, most notably the Leipzig International Bach Competition’s 2014 Christa Bach-Marschall Foundation Prize, and the 2021 Jeffrey Thomas award. When not performing Toma can be found hiking, trail running, and mushroom hunting in the verdant forests of the Pacific Northwest."
